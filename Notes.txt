#########To Run#########
- uvicorn mcp_server.main:app --reload
- python test_client/chat_with_llm.py

#######This was solved############
- Loading onnx model did not work for nomic-embedding-model 
- Most of the online tutorials are outdated , so it is a pain to make it work
- LOAD_ONNX_MODEL_CLOUD , LOAD_ONNX_MODEL using DATA_PUMP_DIR both did not work
- OML4Py did not work on mac as well dev box. 
########Solution############

Download embedding model from https://adwc4pm.objectstorage.us-ashburn-1.oci.customer-oci.com/p/VBRD9P8ZFWkKvnfhrWxkpPe8K03-JIoM5h_8EJyJcpE80c108fuUjg7R5L5O7mMZ/n/adwc4pm/b/OML-Resources/o/all_MiniLM_L12_v2_augmented.zip
